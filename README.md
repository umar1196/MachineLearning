Disease genes prediction using machine learning
##Work flow:

1.Retrieve gene records from NCBI.

2.Store sequences in locally created database.

3.Find similarity score of gene sequences by applying pairwise allignment tool.

4.Form similarity score matrix.

5.Apply machine learning algoritm such as random forest and linear regession to predict disease genes.

6.Machine learning model evaluation using accuracy score, precision, recall and f1 score.
